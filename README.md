A Julia package for tensor networks from a categorical point of view. Tensor
networks are viewed as algebras of the operad of the undirected wiring diagrams.

**Warning**: This repository consists of experimental code plus a few
illustrative examples. It is not ready for serious use but, with some additional
work, could become the basis of a useful package.
